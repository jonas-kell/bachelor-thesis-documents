% TODO 
% - Caution, as Markus said, all regular lattices have some level of larger or smaller scale regularities. Convnets will probably always succeed in that case. Graph nets may be even more effective on highly irregular systems.
% - still hope, that as encoding style and interaction style directly reflect the graph structure, a more efficient representation is possible

% (- hierarchical structure, that limits self attention to blocks)
% (- blocks can be uniformly or non-uniformly assembled)
% - could be interesting as a future research idea on how to perform patching for later lattices more efficiently
