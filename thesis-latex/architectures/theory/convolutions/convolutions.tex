% TODO
% - focus on differences between depthwise and normal convolution
% - symmetrical convolutions with shared weights and their implementation 

% SOURCE: \cite{mobileNetPaper}
% - reduce network size and costs to be able to ship for low power/storage mobile devices

% SOURCE: \cite{channelNets}
% - citation on different styles of convolution channel usage
% - even improves upon depthwise separable convolutions 

% SOURCE: \cite{separableConvolutions}
% - perfect visualization and explanation
