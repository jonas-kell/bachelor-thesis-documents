In order to be able to compare different machine learning architectures, it need to be clear what the architectures are all about. 
For this reason, a brief introduction to basic neural network architectures is given. 
As there is quite a lot of literature on the basic forms of networks, the focus of this section will be explaining the more complex mechanisms.
Basic architectures however, will only be briefly named.
