% TODO
% - suggest how the same general structure is preserved, if the token mixer is switched for alternative
% - performance can stay or improve while reducing computational as well as storage costs 

% SOURCE: \cite{metaformerPaper}
% - token mixer switching 
% - retains or raises accuracy 
% - constant re-embedding with switching layer sizes and modules is a very powerful architectural hyperparameter, but not used in the thesis
