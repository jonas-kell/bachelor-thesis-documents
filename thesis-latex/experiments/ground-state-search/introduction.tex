For the second set of experiments, a quantum mechanical \emph{ground state search} will be implemented and performed.
The goal is to employ multiple metaformer architectures as a NQS and perform VMC (\autoref{sec:theory-neuralquantumstates}) to solve for the ground state.
The speed of convergence and other metrics will be compared.

The code for replicating these experiments was also written in python and can likewise be found on GitHub \cite{selfPhysics}.
The \emph{jax} framework is used to supply the necessary \emph{autograd} and \emph{XLA} functionality \cite{jaxGithub}.
It is extended with the \emph{flax} \cite{flaxGithub} module for improved definitions of machine learning tasks and models.
Finally, the \emph{jVMC} \cite{jVMCgithub} package supplies the base functions the handling quantum mechanical wavefunctions and performing optimizations with VMC.
