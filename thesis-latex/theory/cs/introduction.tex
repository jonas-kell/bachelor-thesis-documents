The first sections gave a brief overview of the problem that needs to be computed, as well as a basic understanding of the performed calculations.
The \fullref{sec:theory-neuralquantumstates} presented the NQS and promised, that its job would be performed by a \emph{neural network}. 
This theory section will give a brief introduction into the basics of neural network training.
